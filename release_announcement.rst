About
-----

Stereonets are a type of plot commonly used in the geosciences for visualizing
and analyzing orientation data.

Orientations of linear and planar features are plotted as the intersection of
the feature with a hemisphere.  (Therefore, linear features plot as points and
planar features plot as lines.)

mplstereonet provides plotting of planes (measured as strikes and dips), poles
to planes, and lineations (measured as rakes along a plane or as plunges and
bearings).

Additionally, mplstereonet provides orientation density contouring using a
variety of standard methods (e.g. "Kamb" contouring, etc).

Getting Started
---------------

The easiest way to get started is to have a look at the examples:

Additionally, the readme has an overview and various examples:

Changes
-------

New features in version 0.2 include:

- Density contouring of orientation data using a variety of methods
- Equal-angle as well as equal-area stereonets
- A variety of parsing utilities
- Geometric analysis utilities (e.g. plane intersections)

Thank you all very much!
